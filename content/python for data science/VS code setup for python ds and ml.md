## The video:

* This one is clear, step by step. However like the title said"Python Tutorial for Beginners with VS Code", it is not specific for data science, if you just wanna start to learn python instantly, it is the video you wanna check out.

* This one is good, but I didn't finish it. I can feel it has good contents, but I am not familiar with the set up or coding stuff, it feels like a complete guide not a quick start guide, so if you are totally new beginner maybe the first one is better.
## The article:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
* The official website for anaconda: you can choose either anaconda or miniconda. The website also offers the advice for "Should I use Anaconda Distribution or Miniconda?"

* note: There is no Anaconda command prompt in macos, just open the terminal in macos, it will be fine. This is clear too, just follow its instuctions, it will be great.

* also for reference

### Conclusion:
* This for quick start for data science, and make sure most often used libraries are set up.
